## Challenge
Create a function that takes an unsorted list and return the same list sorted using quick sort algorithm

## Approach & Efficiency
- `Merge_sort` has big O of `O(n^2)` for time and `O(n)` for space

## API
- `Quicksort`
    ```
    """
    This function takes a list as an input and return the same array with sorted values

    Args:
        list
        left
        right

    Return:
        Sorted list
