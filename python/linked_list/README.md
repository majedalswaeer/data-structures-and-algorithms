# Singly Linked List
This challenge repreasent a singliy linked list with its basics and how to create the nodes and implement them with different methods

## Challenge
Implementing methods on data structures and creating the nodes

## Approach & Efficiency
This challenge enhanced my logic understanding of the linked list
- `Insert` method has O(1) big O complexity for time and space
- `Includes` method has O(n) big O complexity for time and space
- `to_string` method has O(n) big O complexity for time and space

## API
- `instert`
```
        """
Insert creates a Node with the value that was passed and adds
it to the head of the linked list shifting all other values down

Arguments:
value : any

Returns: None
```
- `Includes`

```
Includes Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

Arguments: Value

Returns: Boolean

```
- `to_string`
```
Includes Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

Arguments: none

Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
```
